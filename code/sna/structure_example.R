# calculate the in and out degrees separately
# use the degree() function and options for calculating directed degree
# see the documentation here: http://igraph.sourceforge.net/documentation.html

# see which nodes have the max out and indegree
# for example, if you were to store the outdegree in the vector od,
# you could look up the page name like so:
od <- degree(g, mode = "out")
V(g)$label[which.max(od)]

# find undirected betweenness scores and then nodes with the max betweenness
# warning, can be slow with large graphs, you may consider betweenness.estimate instead
bb = betweenness(g,directed=F)
V(g)$label[which.max(bb)]

# this high betweennes node may seem a bit surprising
# you can check out its neighbors like this. The +1, -1 business is a real
# pain. It is because R indexes from 1 onward, but igraph likes to number
# its vertices starting with 0. So you have to do a back and forth dance
V(g)$label[V(g)[nei(which.max(bb)-1)]+1]

# calculate PageRank and find the node having the highest pagerank
# you'll want the $vector portion of the answer returned
# the assignment doesn't ask about this, but it's good to know how to do this...
